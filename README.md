# BPjs-with-blockly

Google's <a href="https://developers.google.com/blockly">blockly</a> is a diagram editor that was made for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language">Visual Programming</a>. It compiles "blocks" into javascript code. 
This repository is an extenstion of blockly that supports some <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~bprogram/">Behavioral Programming</a> concepts, with a wrapping Java desktop application that runs, monitors, and can interact with the generated Javascript code.

The execution of the generated JS code is done using the <a href="https://github.com/bThink-BGU/BPjs">BPjs</a> environment.
